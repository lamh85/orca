## Migrations

https://github.com/salsita/node-pg-migrate

All the logic in the migration file must be wrapped in either of these exports:

```javascript
exports.shorthands = undefined

exports.up = function up(pgm) {}

exports.down = function down(pgm) {}
```

If the migration file is written in ES6, then the file extension must be `cjs` if `package.json` has this configuration: `"type": "module"`.

**Otherwise, you might receive these errors**

Some of these are not the exact words. I forgot to copy them before fixing the error.
* `pgm` is not defined
* Rename your file to `cjs` or remove `"type": "module"`
* `Warning: require() of ES modules is not supported`
